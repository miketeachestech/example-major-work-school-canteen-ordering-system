# TODO: Your problem definition needs to clearly explain a specific problem and how your software will solve it. Make sure to outline the full scope of your project, any limitations, and give a brief overview of your solution. Be realistic; if the problem you’ve chosen is too ambitious, it could lead to an unmanageable or unrealistic project.

## Problem Definition

The current school canteen ordering process is paper-based and handled manually at the counter. Students place orders by speaking to staff or writing them down, and staff manage these orders without a digital system.

This process creates several inefficiencies:

- **Cash Handling Risks**: Students must bring physical money to school, which is prone to being lost or stolen. Forgetting cash often means missed meals.
- **Manual Tracking**: Staff use paper to track orders and inventory, making it difficult to stay organized, manage stock, or provide refunds accurately.
- **No Order History**: Neither students nor staff have access to past order data, making it impossible to review or confirm what was ordered.
- **Stock Visibility Issues**: Items can sell out without notice, leading to confusion and failed orders.
- **Inefficient Service**: Long queues form during lunch breaks as orders are taken individually, slowing down the service and increasing the risk of mistakes.

This outdated process affects both staff efficiency and student experience, and limits the school’s ability to manage operations smoothly. A digital solution is needed to streamline ordering, improve record-keeping, and eliminate the need for cash transactions.

## Potential Time and Cost Savings

By switching to a digital ordering system, the school can significantly reduce manual work, errors, and cash handling.

### 1. Reduced Manual Order Processing
- **Current time spent**: 1–2 minutes per student order
- **150 orders/day** × 1.5 minutes = **3.75 hours/day**
- **18.75 hours/week** of staff time
- **At $25/hour**: ~$470/month saved

### 2. Fewer Mistakes and Disputes
- Digital tracking means fewer incorrect orders or missing payments
- Less time spent resolving issues or replacing wasted food

> **Estimated savings**: ~$50–$100/month

### 3. No Need for Cash Handling
- No time spent counting or reconciling cash
- Reduced risk of theft or lost money

> **Estimated savings**: ~$100–$200/year in materials and risk reduction

### 4. Faster Lunchtimes, Less Supervision
- Orders are placed ahead of time, shortening queues
- Staff can focus on fulfilling orders instead of processing them

> **Indirect benefits**: smoother canteen flow, better student experience, and more efficient staff use

## Total Estimated Benefit

| Category                   | Estimated Monthly Savings |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Staff Time                | $470                      |
| Error/Waste Reduction     | $75                       |
| Cash Handling/Admin       | $10–$20                   |
| **Total**                 | **$555–$565/month**       |

**Annual Savings**: Over **$5,500 per school year**, not including improved data tracking, service quality, and ease of scaling operations.
