## Problem Definition

The current school canteen ordering process is paper-based and handled manually at the counter. Students place orders by speaking to staff or writing them down, and staff manage these orders without a digital system.

This process creates several inefficiencies:

- **Cash Handling Risks**: Students must bring physical money to school, which is prone to being lost or stolen. Forgetting cash often means missed meals.
- **Manual Tracking**: Staff use paper to track orders and inventory, making it difficult to stay organized, manage stock, or provide refunds accurately.
- **No Order History**: Neither students nor staff have access to past order data, making it impossible to review or confirm what was ordered.
- **Stock Visibility Issues**: Items can sell out without notice, leading to confusion and failed orders.
- **Inefficient Service**: Long queues form during lunch breaks as orders are taken individually, slowing down the service and increasing the risk of mistakes.

This outdated process affects both staff efficiency and student experience, and limits the schoolâ€™s ability to manage operations smoothly. A digital solution is needed to streamline ordering, improve record-keeping, and eliminate the need for cash transactions. By switching to a digital ordering system, the school can significantly reduce manual work, errors, and cash handling.
