# TODO: Your test suite should be thorough, with well-designed test cases that cover all key parts of your software. Use clear, relevant test data and document both the expected and actual results. Clearly state whether each test passed or failed, and explain any fixes or changes made as a result. Aim for a clean, structured format that shows your testing process is complete and reliable. Boundary conditions/edge cases should be checked. Recommended table headers: Test ID, Category, Description, Input, Expected Output, Actual Output, Pass/Fail, Action Taken.
